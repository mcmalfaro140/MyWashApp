When the user opens the Car Wash app, this image will be the first screen that will appear before redirected to the next main page.

These screens will provide the users to login as a registered user or provider as well as sign up as a user or provider. The difference between the two is that providers are the ones who maintain the app and the users are regular customers who are seeking for a car wash.

Once the user registers as a provider or user, the app will redirect them to the login page where they will be able to login as their respective positions.
